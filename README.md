# Feed_Forward_Neural_Networks


A feedforward neural network, also known as a feedforward artificial neural network or simply a feedforward neural network (FNN), is a fundamental architecture in the field of artificial neural networks and machine learning. It is characterized by a series of interconnected processing units or neurons arranged in layers. The network is called "feedforward" because information flows in one direction, from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer, without any loops or feedback connections.
